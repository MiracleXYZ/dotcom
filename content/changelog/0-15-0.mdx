title: Release v0.15.0
---

## Upgrade overview

This release contains upgrade notes that deviate from the norm:

- ⚠️ Requires database migrations: `user.open_id` will be removed.
- The default storage setting for resources will be `local` instead of `database`.

## Features

- Improved the account security with **access tokens**.

  - You can remove the access token to disable the login state from other devices;
  - You can generate access tokens to call APIs, and they can never expire;
  - ... learn more in [Access Tokens](/docs/security/access-tokens).

- Two new pages:

  - **User profile**: A separate home page for yourself.

  - **Resources with timeline view**: Display the resource according to the timeline to solve the problem of disorganization. And you can also quickly find related memos.
