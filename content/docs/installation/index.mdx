Memos offers several installation methods to suit different use cases and environments. Choose the method that works best for your needs.

## Quick Start

For most users, we recommend using Docker as it's the fastest and most reliable way to get started:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name memos \
  --publish 5230:5230 \
  --volume ~/.memos/:/var/opt/memos \
  neosmemo/memos:stable
```

Then visit [http://localhost:5230](http://localhost:5230) to access your Memos instance.
