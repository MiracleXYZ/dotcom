## Prerequisite

- [Know how to contribute](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), requires version >=18.0
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io), requires version >=8.0
- Preferably a markdown editor, Here's a few: [Visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Typora](https://typora.io/). (If not, any text editor is fine)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Step by step

1. Clone your forked repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<You username>/dotcom
   ```

2. Start the dev environment:

   1. Install dependencies:

      ```bash
      npm install
      ```

   2. Start the development server:

      ```bash
      npm run dev
      ```

   Now, the website should be running at http://localhost:3000. It will support live reload upon code changes.

3. Create corresponding markdown files under the `content` folder in the corresponding location.

   **Note**: If it's a whole new section you are adding:

   1. Create the corresonding folder under `content`
   2. Add a `index.md` file inside you newly created folder
   3. Copy what you added in step 6. to the index.md
   4. Replace the title in `##` with:

      ```yaml
          ---
          title: <Your title>
          ---
      ```

4. Add your link into [DOCS_NODES](https://github.com/usememos/dotcom/blob/main/src/app/docs/%5B%5B...slug%5D%5D/navigation.tsx#L16).

5. Enjoy writing!
