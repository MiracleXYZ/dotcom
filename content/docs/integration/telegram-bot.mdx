title: Integration with Telegram Bot
---

**[Memogram](https://github.com/usememos/telegram-integration)** is an easy to use integration service for syncing messages and images from a Telegram bot into your Memos.

## Prerequisite

- Follow the [How Do I Create a Bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots#how-do-i-create-a-bot) to create a **Telegram Bot**.
- Get your **bot token** with [Obtain Your Bot Token](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial#obtain-your-bot-token).

## Installation

Download the binary files for your operating system from the [Releases](https://github.com/usememos/telegram-integration/releases) page.

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory and add the following configuration:

```env
SERVER_ADDR=dns:localhost:5230
BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
```

The `SERVER_ADDR` should be a gRPC server address that the Memos is running on. It follows the [gRPC Name Resolution](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/naming.md).

## Usage

### Starting `memogram`

1. Download and extract the released binary file;
2. Create a `.env` file in the same directory as the binary file;
3. Run the executable in the terminal:

   ```sh
   ./memogram
   ```

4. Once the bot is running, you can interact with it via your Telegram bot.

### Interaction Commands

- `/start <access_token>`: Start the bot with your Memos access token.
- Send text messages: Save the message content as a memo.
- Send files (photos, documents): Save the files as resources in a memo.
