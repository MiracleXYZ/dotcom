description: Create custom shortcuts and use filters to quickly find your memos.
---

Shortcuts are saved searches that help you quickly access specific memos. Think of them as bookmarks for your filtered memo views.

## What are Shortcuts?

A **shortcut** is a named filter that appears in your sidebar for quick access. For example:

- **"Work Tasks"** → Show work memos with task lists
- **"Today's Notes"** → Show memos created today
- **"Important"** → Show pinned memos

## Creating Shortcuts

1. Click **"+ Shortcut"** in your sidebar
2. Give it a descriptive name
3. Write a filter expression (optional)
4. Save

**Example:**
- **Name**: "Work Tasks"
- **Filter**: `"work" in tags && has_task_list`

<Callout type="tip">
Start with simple filters like `"work" in tags` and add complexity as needed.

## Filter Basics

Filters use simple expressions to find specific memos:

```text
content.contains("meeting")    # Text search
"work" in tags                # Has specific tag
pinned                        # Pinned memos only
has_task_list                 # Contains task lists
```

## Common Filter Examples

### By Tags
```text
"work" in tags                    # Work memos
tag in ["urgent", "important"]   # Multiple tag options
!("archive" in tags)             # Exclude archived
```

### By Time
```text
created_ts > now() - 86400       # Last 24 hours
created_ts > now() - 604800      # Last week
```

### By Content Type
```text
has_task_list                    # Contains tasks
has_incomplete_tasks             # Has unfinished tasks
has_link                         # Contains links
has_code                         # Contains code blocks
```

### By Properties
```text
pinned                           # Pinned memos
visibility == "PUBLIC"           # Public memos
size(tags) == 0                  # Untagged memos
```

## Combining Filters

Use `&&` (AND) and `||` (OR) to combine conditions:

```text
# Work tasks from this week
"work" in tags && has_task_list && created_ts > now() - 604800

# Important or urgent items
pinned || "urgent" in tags

# Recent personal notes (not work)
"personal" in tags && !("work" in tags) && created_ts > now() - 86400
```

## Popular Shortcut Ideas

| Name | Filter | What it shows |
|------|--------|---------------|
| Today's Tasks | `has_incomplete_tasks && created_ts > now() - 86400` | Today's unfinished tasks |
| Work Notes | `"work" in tags` | All work-related memos |
| Quick Notes | `size(tags) == 0` | Untagged memos |
| Important | `pinned || "important" in tags` | Pinned or important memos |
| Recent | `created_ts > now() - 604800` | This week's memos |

## Troubleshooting

**No results?**
- Check tag spelling: `"work"` not `work`
- Verify time ranges are realistic
- Test with simpler filters first

**Syntax errors?**
- Use quotes around text: `"work"`
- Balance parentheses: `(condition1 || condition2)`
- Use `&&` for AND, `||` for OR
