Secure your Memos account and manage access across different devices and applications.

Memos uses **sessions** for web browsers (14-day auto-renewal) and **access tokens** for apps and APIs (long-lived with optional expiration).

## First-Time Setup

Navigate to your Memos URL and create your account:

1. Choose a username (permanent, cannot be changed)
2. Set a strong password
3. Add display name (optional)

<Callout type="warning">
The first user becomes the administrator with full system access.
</Callout>

**Regular login:** Enter username and password, then click "Sign In". Forgot password? Contact your administrator.

## Sessions

Sessions keep you logged in for 14 days from your last activity. Each use extends the expiration.

**View active sessions:** Settings → Sessions shows all devices (device type, browser, OS, IP, last activity).

**Revoke a session:** Click "Revoke" next to any session to immediately log out that device.

**Logout options:**
- Current device: Profile icon → Logout
- All devices: Revoke all sessions except current in Settings

<Callout type="tip">
Review sessions weekly. Revoke any you don't recognize immediately.
</Callout>

## Access Tokens

Tokens provide API access for mobile apps, desktop apps, CLI tools, integrations, and backup scripts.

**Create a token:**
1. Settings → Access Tokens → "Create New Token"
2. Enter descriptive name ("My iPhone", "Backup Script")
3. Set expiration: 7/30/90/365 days or never
4. Copy token immediately (shown only once!)

<Callout type="error">
Tokens are shown only during creation. Store securely or create a new one.
</Callout>

**Use your token:**

Mobile apps: Paste token in app settings under "Server" or "Authentication".

CLI tools:
```bash
export MEMOS_TOKEN="your_token_here"
# Or store in secure file: chmod 600 ~/.memos/token
```

API calls:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://memos.example.com/api/v1/memos
```

**Revoke tokens:** Settings → Access Tokens → "Delete". Token stops working immediately.

Revoke when: device lost, app unused, suspected compromise, or regular rotation.

## Security Best Practices

**Sessions:**
- Review weekly for unknown devices
- Always logout from public computers
- Use HTTPS in production
- Revoke unknown sessions immediately

**Tokens:**
- One token per device/app
- Use descriptive names
- Set expiration dates
- Rotate regularly
- Store in password managers, never in git

**Passwords:**
- 12+ characters minimum
- Use password manager
- Never reuse passwords
- Change if compromised

## Multi-Device Setup

**Web browsers:** Log in with username/password on each device. Sessions last 14 days.

**Mobile apps:** Create token named "My iPhone", set 90-day expiration, enter in app settings.

**Scripts/CLI:** Create token named "Backup Script", set 1-year expiration (or never), store in environment variable.

**OAuth SSO:** If enabled by administrator, log in with GitHub, Google, or GitLab. You can still create tokens for apps.

## If Your Account Is Compromised

**Warning signs:** Unknown sessions, memos you didn't create, changed settings, deleted content, unexpected tokens.

**Immediate steps:**
1. Revoke all sessions (Settings → Sessions)
2. Change password immediately
3. Revoke all tokens (Settings → Access Tokens)
4. Create new tokens for trusted apps only
5. Contact administrator
6. Review all activity

**Monthly security checks:** Review sessions and tokens, verify all devices are yours, remove unused tokens.

## API Authentication

**Session-based (web apps):**
```javascript
// Login with credentials
const response = await fetch('/api/v1/auth/sessions', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    password_credentials: { username: 'your_username', password: 'your_password' }
  }),
  credentials: 'include'
});

// Make requests (cookie sent automatically)
const memos = await fetch('/api/v1/memos', { credentials: 'include' });
```

**Token-based (apps & scripts):**
```javascript
const memos = await fetch('https://memos.example.com/api/v1/memos', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
});

// Handle auth errors
if (response.status === 401) {
  console.error('Authentication failed - token may be expired');
}
```

## FAQ

**How long do sessions last?** 14 days from last activity. Each use extends expiration.

**Can I use multiple devices?** Yes! Each gets its own session or token.

**What happens when I revoke a token?** Stops working immediately. Apps lose access.

**Should I use sessions or tokens for mobile apps?** Tokens. They don't expire from inactivity.

**Are they secure?** Yes! Sessions use HTTP-only cookies, tokens are JWT-signed. Use HTTPS in production.

**What if I expose a token?** Revoke immediately in Settings → Access Tokens, create new one.
